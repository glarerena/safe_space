# Safe Space Sleeping Campaign

A hybrid awareness and education project focused on two critical issues impacting South Carolina communities:

1. **Infant safe sleep practices** to reduce preventable sleep-related deaths
2. **Family education** to support caregivers and parents affected by incarceration

This landing page is being developed for **53205**, an advocacy initiative led by Myeshia Bates of South Carolina. The campaign aims to combine trauma-informed family support with public health outreach — with a focus on dignity, equity, and second chances.

**Note:** This project is independent and not affiliated with any reentry program. It focuses solely on **family education** and safe sleep advocacy.
