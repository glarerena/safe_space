# Safe Space, Stronger Families

A public awareness and education campaign for **infant safe sleep** and **family reunification** in South Carolina. Developed for **53205**, an advocacy initiative led by **Myeshia Bates**.

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with **TypeScript** and **CSS Modules**, and was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It is designed as a responsive, accessible landing page with a focus on dignity, equity, and second chances.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To start editing the landing page, go to:

```

Changes will automatically update in your browser.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family from Vercel.

## Campaign Overview

Safe Space, Stronger Families is a hybrid public awareness campaign focused on two critical issues impacting South Carolina communities:

- Promoting infant safe sleep practices to reduce preventable sleep-related deaths  
- Providing trauma-informed family education for caregivers impacted by incarceration

The campaign is part of **53205**, a community initiative led by **Myeshia Bates**, and aims to combine public health outreach with justice-informed family support.
